CopyPics copies JPEG and RAW files from one directory to another. It copies
the source files to a directory named yyyy-mm-dd in the target directory. The
yyyy-mm-dd directory is created based on the modification time of the file that
is being copied. CopyPics can delete the source files, by using the -d option.

Compiling and "installing" it is a simple matter of calling make:

    1. $ make
    2. cp exe/copypics /usr/local/bin/

Start copypics without any options (or with the -h option) and you'll get a
short usage example.

This was originally a BASH script, but I felt like doing it in Ada, so I did.
There are no gains from doing it in Ada, except I had some fun.

Enjoy!
