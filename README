CopyPics copies JPEG and RAW files from one directory to another. It copies
the source files to a directory named yyyy-mm-dd in the target directory. The
yyyy-mm-dd directory is created based on the modification time of the file that
is being copied. CopyPics can delete the source files, by using the -d option.

This was originally a BASH script, but I felt like doing it in Ada, so I did.

Enjoy!
